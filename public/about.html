    <p>Hi there! My name is Morgan, pleasure to meet you. I went to college at UNIVERSITY before becoming a Customer Support Technician at COMPANY. I like working in the tech industry,
        specifically with software as I get to troubleshoot a lot of issues that keep my brain engaged. Long term I hope to become a team lead in web development.
    </p>

        When I'm not coding or working, I like to play videogames, shop at vintage/thrift stores, and make art. I really like making rugs and have been doing this for a little over a year
        now. Most recently I've picked up crocheting, and next I think I want to get into block printing!
